# 2D GAME PLANNING DOC! 
The primary objective for the design of our 2D game is to fuse high-intensity combat
with a high-stakes "hide-and-seek" tension, forcing players to move away from mindless
shooting and toward tactical environmental awareness. 
## THINGS TO STREAMLINE/SIMPLIFY (from prof's feedback)
- Magic system 
- Final Boss 
- Branching skills and perks 
- Dashing and climbing 
- Evaluating what a more difficult shot is
- Enemies + enemy behavior 
- Procedural progression (out of scope again)
- Dev. process
